### Sagift Relief Mobile Application

## Projects Description

<div align="justify">
The project aims to create a mobile application that allows users to donate to charities through their mobile devices. To use the app, users need to register or log in. Once logged in, they will be directed to the home page, where they can explore available products, view and edit their profile details, access published items, and initiate the donation process by clicking the donate button. During the donation process, users can add a photo of the item being donated, personalize their item lists, and assign favorite items to different users. The final selection of donated items will be displayed in the cart for review before confirmation. The mobile application will be developed using React Native and will be launched after thorough testing.
